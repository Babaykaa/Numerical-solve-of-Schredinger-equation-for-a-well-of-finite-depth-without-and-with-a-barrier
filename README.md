# Numerical solve of Schredinger equation for a well of finite depth without and with a barrier
The repository contains the application code for finding a numerical solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation for a well of finite depth and a well of finite depth with a barrier of finite height.
The program is an application with a graphical user interface, with the ability to set parameters for the height and width of the pit, the mass of the particle and the height and width of the barrier. After finding the energy levels, it is possible to select the wave functions or probability densities to be drawn, with the ability to set the color of each of the curves, as well as the scaling factor of the rendered functions.
